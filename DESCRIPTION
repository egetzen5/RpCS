Description: Coronavirus has spread through most countries in the world. Xi (2020) developed a novel Monte Carlo simulation procedure for modeling Covid19 spread over time. In this package, we implement the simulation, recreate Fig 2 which explores active infections over a number of days under a variety of parameter settings (see paper), and additionally we incorporate a daily hospitalization rate into the simulation.
